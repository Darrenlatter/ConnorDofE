    <p>Welcome to my site!</p>
    <p>I am learning how to design and build a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will be using free online resources such as tutorials, videos, and coding platforms (like W3Schools, FreeCodeCamp, and YouTube) to help me understand how websites are made and how to write code.</p>
    <p>Over the weeks I will practise by writing code myself, testing it, and gradually adding more features to my web page. I will start with simple layouts and text, then add styles using CSS, and later make the page interactive using JavaScript.</p>
    <p>I have a mentor who will guide me, check my progress, and give me feedback on my code and design. By the end of the project, I aim to have a working website that shows what I have learned, with good structure, design, and some interactive elements.</p></div>

    <dl>
      <dt>Week 1 – Getting Started (HTML basics)</dt>
        <dd>“I learned how to structure a webpage using headings and paragraphs. At first, it looked confusing, but once I saw the tags working in the browser, it made sense. I liked seeing text I wrote appear on the page.”</dd>
      <dt>Week 2 – Adding Style (CSS basics)</dt>
        <dd>“This week I used CSS to change colours and fonts. It was fun experimenting with different looks. I found it tricky to get the background and text to contrast well, but I solved it by testing on different screens.”</dd>
      <dt>Week 3 – Images and Links</dt>
        <dd>“I learned how to insert images and make links clickable. It was great to link to my favourite website. The hardest part was resizing images so they didn’t look stretched.”</dd>
      <dt>Week 4 – Navigation Menus</dt>
        <dd>“I built a simple navigation bar. I struggled with the menu alignment, but after looking at examples, I got it to line up properly. It feels more like a ‘real’ website now.”</dd>
      <dt>Week 5 – Layouts with CSS<</dt>
        <dd>“This week I worked with page layouts. I learned how to create columns and adjust spacing. It took a few tries to stop things overlapping, but I managed to fix it by using margins.”</dd>
      <dt>Week 6 – Responsive Design<</dt>
        <dd>“I made the site work on mobile. Testing on my phone was really useful. At first, the text was too big, but I changed the CSS so it looked better. Now the site works on both desktop and phone.”</dd>
      <dt>Week 7 – Adding a Contact Form</dt>
        <dd>“I created a simple form with boxes for name and email. It was interesting to see how forms can be used. The hardest part was making it look neat, but CSS helped me fix it.”</dd>
       <dt>Week 8 – Embedding Media</dt>
        <dd>“I embedded a YouTube video and some audio. I had never done this before, but it was exciting to see video play inside my website. I felt proud when it worked.”</dd>
      <dt>Week 9 – Interactivity with JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>“I learned how to add a button that changes the background colour. It was tricky because I kept making mistakes with the code, but after checking carefully, I got it working.”</dd>
      <dt>Week 10 – Improving Design</dt>
        <dd>“I polished the website by adding borders, shadows, and better spacing. I really like how it looks more professional now. It felt good to see how much my design has improved.”</dd>
      <dt>Week 11 – Publishing the Website</dt>
        <dd>“I published my site online using GitHub Pages. At first, I couldn’t get the files to upload correctly, but once I followed the steps, it worked. I felt proud to share my link with friends.”</dd>
      <dt>Week 12 – Final Review<</dt>
        <dd>“I looked back at my whole project. I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The most enjoyable part was adding videos and making the site interactive. I now feel more confident using IT skills.”</dd>
