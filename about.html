  <p><h3>Hi, my name is Connor Latter. I’m 15 years old and recently completed my Bronze Duke of Edinburgh’s Award. Taking part in DofE taught me how to work as part of a team, stay determined when things get tough, and push myself to achieve new goals.
  As part of the award, I developed a new skill, took part in regular physical activities, and volunteered to help others. The highlight was completing my expedition, where I learned how to read maps, navigate as part of a group, and keep going even when I was tired or the weather wasn’t on my side.
  Outside of DofE, I enjoy learning about technology and building things with computers, especially creating websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also like spending time outdoors, exploring new places, and challenging myself to try new things.
  Completing my Bronze DofE has given me more confidence and shown me that with effort and teamwork, I can achieve much more than I thought possible. I’m now looking forward to new challenges in the future, including working towards my Silver Award.</p>

  <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Football</li> I really enjoy playing football, both casually with friends and in organised matches at school. Playing football helps me stay active, improve my fitness, and build teamwork skills. I like the challenge of working with my team to create chances, defend well, and celebrate when we score.
    <li>Gaming</li> When I’m not playing sports outside, I enjoy gaming, especially playing Rocket League. It combines football and cars in a fun and competitive way, which I find both exciting and challenging. I like playing online with friends, practising strategies, and improving my ranking. It also helps me build quick reactions and problem-solving skills.
    <li>Basketball</li>Basketball is another sport I like to play, especially because it’s fast-paced and exciting. It has taught me how important quick decision-making and communication are on the court. I enjoy practising my shooting and dribbling, and I find it rewarding when I improve my skills over time.
